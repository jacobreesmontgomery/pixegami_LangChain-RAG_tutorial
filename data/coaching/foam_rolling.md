FOAM ROLLING
OVERVIEW
Foam rolling is fairly self-explanatory; you get a foam roller and roll out on it. There are many benefits to foam rolling such as increasing range of motion, increasing blood flow, reducing perceived pain/soreness, amongst other things. This is a good way to loosen up and mobilize the body before and after runs. There are many areas you can roll out, but with running, the focus should largely be on the lower body where a lot of the force of running goes. I'd advise against rolling out your IT band as that fascia is meant to be tight, and recent studies suggest against doing this. The areas to foam roll below obviously do not encompass all possibilities, but it's a great starting point and covers the bases for most. The only other thing you may want to hit is the TFL, however, that's best rolled out with a ball-shaped object such as a foam ball, lacrosse ball, golf ball, etc.
