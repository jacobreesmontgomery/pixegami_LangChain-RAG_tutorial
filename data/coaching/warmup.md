WARMUP
OVERVIEW
The objective of warmups is to prepare the body for whatever stimuli is to come (e.g., thresholds, fast intervals, etc.). Based on the individual, this can look like a variety of things. When optimized, they will be "in the groove" or feeling good right from the start. If not optimal, they may feel like it takes them some time to feel good. Generally, a good warmup consists of a slow progression in pace on the jogging portion, roughly 10-15 minutes in length. For FT runners, this warmup can dip under 10 minutes even, but typically for ST runners there's a need for a longer warm up jog. The pace should start as a slow jog or even walk and end at one's typical easy pace (or a bit faster). This warms up the body and gets you largely physiologically primed. After the progressive warmup jog, one should then go into a dynamic warmup (see the “DYNAMICS + PLYOMETRICS” section). The final step is to do some fast strides, say, 3-5x10-20" progressive strides w/ walk-back recovery or until you feel light and peppy, as the final neurological primer. Notably, you should probably tag on some near-maximal sprints in the case of a faster, 1500-800m specific workout. At this point, you are ready to get into the workout.

GENERAL STRUCTURE
Summarizing the structure discussed above, we have the following steps: 
Progressive warmup jog of 10-15 minutes, starting at a slow jog and finishing perhaps a bit faster than easy pace.
Dynamic warmup, starting with lighter movements and then transitioning into more powerful, dynamic (and plyometric) movements.
Fast strides, say 3-5, of 10-20" in length, dependent upon the workout ahead. 
Workout time!

For easy runs and long runs, the process can look more like this:
Dynamic warmuhp with mostly lighter movements
Easy run time!

EXAMPLE
Here's an example warmup for an athlete whose typical easy run pace is 7:20/mile: 
15' easy starting at 8:00/mile and finishing at 7:00/mile
10' dynamic warmup including... 
Knee pulls/hugs, quad stretch, figure 4 stretch, hamstring scoops, toe walks, heel walks, leg swings, THEN
A-skips, B-skips, high knees, ankle hops, both-leg hops
4x15" strides w/ walk-back recovery
