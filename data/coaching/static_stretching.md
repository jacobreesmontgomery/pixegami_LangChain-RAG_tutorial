STATIC STRETCHING
OVERVIEW
Static stretching is a more passive form of stretching compared to dynamic stretching which involves holding various stretching positions for extended periods of time, say 10-60 seconds per repetition. Static stretching, although in the past viewed as a necessary and helpful activity pre-run, has since been proven as ineffective before runs. Now, it's more something that you can do AFTER runs if you so desire. Really, it comes down to if you feel it makes you feel better or not. If it doesn't, it's probably not worth your time. Personally, I don't do any static stretching unless I'm feeling particularly sore in one area, in which case I may do some 30-second holds to work that spot out. Notably, based on scientific studies, it does take roughly 10 weeks of consistent, daily static stretching to truly lengthen a muscle (if that is your desire).

EXAMPLE
Here's a simple, five-exercise static stretching routine: 
Quad stretch - 3x10" each leg (alternating)
Pigeon pose - 3x1' each leg (alternating)
Hamstring stretch with band - 3x30" each leg (alternating)
Frog stretch - 3x30"
Knee hugs - 3x30" each leg
