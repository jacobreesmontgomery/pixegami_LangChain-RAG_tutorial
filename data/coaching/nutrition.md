NUTRITION
OVERVIEW
Nutrition is an important and underlooked piece of training which can have a significant impact on recoverability. The key is to have a healthy and diverse diet with plenty of vegetables and fruits, grains, carbs, protein (fish is great), and fiber (seeds of any form). When it comes to marathon training, it's especially important that you're feeding your body enough protein and carbs as otherwise, your muscles, tissue, fascia, etc. may struggle to repair from all the training stress. Importantly, look to integrate plenty of omega 3s into your diet, and if you feel it is lacking you might want to consider fish oil supplements. These are a big help in the recovery process. Additionally, be sure to consume plenty of electrolytes (aka salt) to maintain your water balance, as otherwise you may notice that all that water you‚Äôre drinking is going right out of your body quite frequently (and with a very clear color). In this scenario, your muscles are not being effectively hydrated as all the water is leaving your body. With a healthy mix of electrolytes to water, your body is able to send a lot of that water to your muscles for hydration (which helps recovery). When it comes to nearing bedtime, a general rule of thumb is to avoid any sugary foods within a couple hours of sleep; if you do like to have something after dinner in the form of a sweet, consider swapping your highly sugary desserts for something milder that‚Äôll still meet your craving (refer below for some pre-bedtime desserts). Or, if you‚Äôre like HECK NO and want to keep having those awesome bowls of ice cream, maybe do it a few hours out from bedtime for more of a buffer (and/or reducing the amount consumed). Another thing to note is that you should really avoid caffeine beyond noon. This is because caffeine has a half life of five hours, meaning that if you have a cup of coffee at 4 PM, your body still contains half of that caffeine at 9 PM, and it won‚Äôt have fully exited your body until 2 AM while you‚Äôre (hopefully) sleeping. This will have a negative impact on your sleep, particularly when it comes to time taken to fall asleep. If you really need to meet that coffee craving, try swapping out that afternoon cup for a decaf coffee. It may not have the effects you want on your energy levels, but it‚Äôll still give you that lovely taste which is half the fun of coffee! 

PROTEIN IS OP
If you didn‚Äôt already know, protein (plus carbs in the case of runners) is critical to recovery. For this reason, it is important that you consume a medium to high dose of protein and carbs within 30-60 minutes of a workout/lift (this includes long runs) to accelerate the recovery process. This can come in the form of a quick and easy protein powder or snack (e.g., a banana with peanut butter and almonds or greek yogurt with raisins and fruit). Of course, you‚Äôll also want to get in a nice, full meal following activity which takes priority over the post-workout protein boost. Thus, if you‚Äôre finding the protein powder/snack post-workout/lift is reducing your appetite for that bigger meal to follow, you may want to drop the protein powder/snack so you can eat an appropriately sized meal. Or, at least reduce the amount of powder/snack you have so you at least get some quick protein and carbs in. 

Here‚Äôs a little tip: consider getting in a hit of protein and minimal carbs about two hours out from bedtime. This will help boost your recovery while you‚Äôre sleeping such that your human growth hormone (critical to performance) and increased protein levels work together to repair the body and get you in a state to crush it in the days to come. This has been scientifically proven. On top of that, consider taking tart cherry juice paired with magnesium powder to improve your sleep. The tart cherry juice has anti-inflammatory antioxidants and helps relax your muscles, while the magnesium helps with joint health and also relaxing you before bed.

FUELING
Fueling is critical when it comes to the marathon. It is important that you consume plenty of fact-acting carbohydrates throughout the marathon and many of your long runs to avoid a horrible experience in the last handful of miles. The general rule of thumb is to consume 60-90 grams of carbohydrates per hour from multiple carb sources (for better absorption). The pros will take in carbs every 5k or so which comes out to about every 14-15 minutes. That means they‚Äôre taking in fuel four times an hour!! For a more amateur runner, this is a bit extreme. I like to recommend a gel every 30 minutes, meaning for a three hour marathoner that would be a gel at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 minutes (aka five gels in total). Some people like to take a gel within 10-30 minutes of the race start, but you don‚Äôt have to do that; it‚Äôs a risky option for those who have a history of digestive issues. You‚Äôll have to experiment to find the gels that work best for you, so try out various kinds and see for yourself what you like and don‚Äôt like.

Although fueling is most often associated with the marathon, there is merit to mid-workout fueling for those training for faster distances as well (half marathon down to the 800). Athletes such as those from the highly successful OAC have been known to consume carbohydrate mixtures throughout longer workouts to give them a little boost of mental/physical energy and, more importantly, help with recovery. There are plenty of good carb mixes out there that you can mix in with your water bottle, so this is something to consider for sure! A good time to get down some carbs is in between reps for workouts that have breaks throughout. As for workouts that don‚Äôt have a break like a long steady tempo, you might be out of luck, although I‚Äôm sure you could find a way! This is more marathoners are well acquainted with.

HEALTHY FOODS TO WORK INTO YOUR DIET
Seeds (fat, fiber, omega 3s)
Hemp
Flax - very high in omega 3s (great for recovery)
Chia - fairly high in omega 3s, just not as much as flax
Sunflower
Complete proteins
Meats like chicken, pork, etc. (less red meats, ideally)
Seafood - shrimp, fish (salmon is great for its anti-inflammatory properties and omega 3s), scallops, etc.
Vegetarian/vegan options - Edamame and quinoa
Dairy
Greek yogurt (high in protein, some fat)
Cottage cheese (quite high in protein, some fat)
Grains
Rice (brown rice is healthier than white rice, jasmine rice or basmati are healthier options too)
Oatmeal (steel oats are very good for you but regular oatmeal is good too, just look for the minimally processed kinds)

HEALTHY PRE-BEDTIME ‚ÄúDESSERTS‚Äù
Cottage cheese or greek yogurt with some fruit and/or granola and/or peanut butter
Banana paired with some almonds (or other nuts like cashews/walnuts)
Small bowl of oatmeal (overnight oats or regular cooked oats) with some fruit, nuts, and/or granola
Protein balls (example recipe here)
Anything else that‚Äôs got protein and a small amount of carbs (don‚Äôt want much sugar, impacts sleep) üôÇ

EXAMPLE
Here's an example of a healthy day of eating:
Breakfast - Oatmeal with banana and strawberries, granola, some maple syrup, chia seeds, and peanut butter.
Lunch - Peanut butter and jelly sandwich + an orange
Dinner - Brown rice and grilled chicken with a vegetable medley (broccoli, asparagus, carrots, and brussel sprouts)
