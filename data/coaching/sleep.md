SLEEP
OVERVIEW
Sleep is the #1 recovery tool and has a plethora of benefits. The general recommendation is to get 7-9 hours of sleep, depending on your individual circumstance. For an endurance athlete, where sleep is particularly important to peak performance, it’s generally best to err towards the range of 8-9 hours, but 8 should be plenty for most. A good rule of thumb is that the harder you train, the more you should sleep to ensure a full recovery. Without adequate sleep, the risk of injury, illness, decreased performance, and other bad things is significantly higher. 

SLEEP BREAKDOWN
Sleep is a cyclical process, each cycle taking roughly 90 minutes, involving multiple stages:
Non-REM - Phase 1
Non-REM - Phase 2
Non-REM - Phase 3
REM - Phase 4

Each of these phases holds unique benefits, thus making all of them important in their own ways. For more detailed information, see the link below under the “Articles” section of the “LINKS” header.

THE FOUR CORE SLEEP METRICS
Matthew Walker defines four important components to sleep: QQRT.
Q: Quantity - The total amount of sleep time (including time awake).
Q: Quality - The total amount of time asleep (excluding time awake).
Calculations
Quality = Quantity - total time awake.
Sleep rating = Quality / quantity.
Example:
Stats:
Time asleep by: 10:00 PM
Total time awake throughout the night: 30 minutes
Wake-up time: 6:15 AM
Quality = Quantity - total time awake = (8h*60m + 15m) - 30m = 8h15m - 30m = 7h45m
Sleep rating = (7h*60m + 45m) / (8h*60m + 15m) = 94%
R: Regularity - The consistency of your sleep schedule.
Is there consistency to your sleep schedule? Are you falling asleep and waking up around the same times each day of the week? 
Matthew mentions this as the most important component of QQRT. Interestingly, he mentioned that it’s better to NOT “sleep in” on the weekend and wake up closer to your normal weekday wake-up time for the purpose of maintaining regularity of sleep.
T: Timing - When you wake up and fall asleep.
Is your timing within the recommended timeline of your chronotype (see quiz link below to find out yours)? Are you working with or against your body's natural circadian rhythm?

PROTOCOLS FOR IMPROVING SLEEP
Here are some general recommendations for getting good sleep:
Reduce light exposure in the hours leading up to sleep (aka get off TikTok!!)
Avoid heavy eating within two hours of sleep, particularly highly sugary foods. Similarly, you should avoid over-hydrating (err on the side of less water in the hour or two leading into sleep).
“Get warm to cool down to fall asleep, stay cool to stay asleep, and warm up to wake up.” - Matthew Walker, PhD
Get warm to cool down to fall asleep
Ensure that you are in a cool space, ideally 65-67 degrees, where your core body temperature can drop 1-3 degrees before sleep. This will give you the smoothest transition into sleep. Interestingly, when nearing sleep, your body should warm up on the outside in a process called vasodilation. This is where the heat rises to the surface of your skin, drawing heat away from your core, thus causing a drop in your core temperature.
Two effective ways to induce vasodilation include…
Taking a moderately warm bath / shower
Wearing socks
Stay cool to stay asleep
In order to stay asleep, you must stay cool. This will prevent you from waking up during the night, thus improving sleep quality.
Warm up to wake up
To avoid feeling groggy, it is best for your body to warm up leading into wake-up time.
Have a relaxing night routine to wind down in the last 30-60 minutes before sleep
This may include reading, meditation, light stretching, listening to a podcast, and/or anything else that relaxes you.
