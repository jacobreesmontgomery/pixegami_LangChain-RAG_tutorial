BIOMECHANICS
OVERVIEW
Many sports have a heavy focus on form: tennis, golf, field events like discus and pole vault, sprints, swimming, etc. For runners, they rarely experience this. Most runners will navigate this road on their own, finding the form that works best for their body having never been told how to run properly. Although this works out for some, many find themselves running in compensatory, damaging ways, leading to recurring injuries (myself included). There’s a reason that over 80% of runners get injured every year… With this in mind, working on form can be a truly transformative experience for a runner, especially one who clearly has some flaws in their gait and/or that gets injured a LOT. Per the words of the famous Australian form coach Paul Mackinnon, otherwise known as “The Balanced Runner,” it is best to improve form in a methodical manner in which you focus on one cue at a time, dialing that one in until it’s automatic before moving on to another cue. Importantly, when working on a new cue, you should think about how it feels different from the old way of running. Feel the difference in your back/shoulders, hips, and feet. Do you notice less rotation in your upper body? Less over-extension in your hips? More of a midfoot landing? Start by running out and back 30 or so yards, alternating between the old and new way of running every 10 yards or so. Once you can feel the difference, you can begin to work this new, improved way of running into your easy runs. Any time you notice yourself falling back to your old movement habits, don’t fight it. Reset by running your old way for a time before then transitioning back to the new way. Repeat this process run after run until you feel the new way of running has become automatic such that you no longer have to think about the cue to successfully use it. At that point, you’re ready to move on to another cue if necessary! Paul says that this mastery process may take varying amounts of time depending on the athlete and the severity of their flawed movement, but generally, you can expect to form automaticity after roughly 10-12 runs.

CUES
There are many cues that can be effective for an individual. These cues may look different from one person to the next so there is really no one-size-fits-all. However, there are some cues that work well for MOST runners that Paul Mackinnon has shared through his membership program which I will outline here, amongst any others I deem valuable.

ARM SWING
The core principles
Counter-movement
The arms are the counter-movers to the legs. If you have limited or excessive movement, this will impact your leg movement. With not enough movement, your legs won’t have enough time for the leg swing. If you have excessive movement, your legs will have too much time and you’ll likely overstride.
Counter-balance
If the movements are different left to right, it will impact your balance from the left to right sides. This is where you can see left/right-side dominance.
Counter-time
If you don’t give enough time to go through a movement, it becomes rushed. On the opposite end, the movement becomes overly slow. 
Lift
If you’re moving horizontally with your arms, you’re missing a lift in your stride for power/speed.
Basic rundown
Strive to have an acute angle at the elbow joint (hands and wrists above the elbow). This means a shorter pendulum which means less energy required. Think about cradling the elbow, like you’re holding a football tightly to your body.
 Your running triangle is the shape of your arms as they naturally fall in front of your body in a running position. This is the angle you should swing your arms on. They should not be swung at perfect 90 degree angles; you should work with your own anatomy. 
The elbow should be thought of as a focal (or lift) point; think of a grandfather clock’s pendulum or the amusement park ships. This is a 50/50 even distribution swing of forward and backward. Think back and up, forward and up with your elbows driving everything else. At no point should you think of moving your hands/wrists; the swing should be entirely driven by the elbows.
Don’t swing across your midline, but you can swing up towards your midline and chin. From the back, it’s okay if you come out a bit; this allows your upper back to stay open and still through the movement. Again, work with YOUR angles.
For slower speeds, think about reaching around sternum height. As you get faster, your hands will reach higher. Try to free up the movement so it is smooth and unforced. It may feel mechanical being that it’s a new movement but try to not force it.
Practicing the new movement
Go out and back multiple times to practice the new movement, using landmarks as guides. Make it as natural as possible.
Start by alternating the new and old ways to separate the movement and build that neuromuscular connection. Focus on how the old and new ways feel in these three spots:
Back
How much movement? How does it feel? How is it positioned?
Upper legs
How much movement? How much extension are you getting? How much knee lift? 
Feet
How light/heavy do my feet feel? Where am I landing on my feet?
Final words
When do I use this cue?
Every run regardless of the run type (workout, long run, easy run, etc.). It should be practiced every time to develop fluency in that new movement. After 10-12 runs, you’ve had a lot of repetitions and may start to feel like the new movement is becoming normal/automatic.
Two things that never change in this cue:
The angle of your swing
The elbow serving as the focal point of the pendulum
Things that do change with the cue based on pace
The amplitude of your swing
The frequency of your swing
Focus on this cue and the outcome will be positive changes in other areas of your body. You don’t need to focus on anything but the one cue. Don’t do multiple cues at once as it’s too much to focus on.
When do I move on to the next cue?
If your cue has become habitual/automatic (aka you no longer have to think about it to do it), then you’re ready to move on to another cue if necessary.
