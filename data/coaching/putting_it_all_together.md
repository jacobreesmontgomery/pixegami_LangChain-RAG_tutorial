PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER: WU + RUN + CD + POST-RUN ROUTINE
EXAMPLE
Putting everything together, here is an example structuring for an easy run:
Brief massage gun / foam-rolling on the key muscles (quads, hammies, calves, glutes)
Dynamic warmup: Toe walks, heel walks, quad stretch, figure 4 / piriformis stretch, hamstring scoops, hip openers and closers, frankensteins, sideways lunges, squats, side skipping and forward skipping while swinging arms (to open up the upper body)
Easy run + 5’ walk
(Optional) self-massage where needed + more massage gun/foam-rolling to flush out the body

For a long run, the only difference would be I’d get in a protein shake post-run before/during the self-massage to promote muscle recovery after all that stress your body has undergone. 

As for workout days, here is an example setup:
Brief massage gun / foam-rolling on the key muscles (quads, hammies, calves, glutes)
Light dynamic stretching (to warm up the body before the warmup jog): Toe walks, heel walks, quad stretch, figure 4 / piriformis stretch, hamstring scoops, hip openers and closers, frankensteins, sideways lunges, squats
10-15 ‘ warmup starting at a slow jog and progressing to 15-20” faster than typical easy run pace
More active dynamic movements: Leg swings, A-skips, B-skips, C-skips, side skipping and forward skipping while swinging arms (to open up the upper body), high knees, crossovers to side-to-sides
4x100m strides w/ walk-back recoveries 
Workout + 5’ walk
(Optional) self-massage where needed + more massage gun/foam-rolling to flush out the body all while drinking a protein shake (to promote muscle recovery)
