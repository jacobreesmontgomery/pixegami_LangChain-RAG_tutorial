STRENGTH TRAINING
OVERVIEW
Strength training is an important piece of the puzzle that can one, build up your resiliency/durability for injury prevention, and two, improve your performance. In its simplest form, strength training can be broken down into these basic, core movements: lunge, squat, hinge, push, pull. Doing these core movements of any form/variation will get you far, so lifts do not have to be complex. Generally, one should shoot for two to three 30-60' strength sessions per week, which more often than not should be done six or more hours after run workouts so you’re adequately recovered going into the lift (although it’s okay to do it immediately following, you just may want to dial back the lift in duration and/or intensity). You can do a lift on a non-workout day, but then that day is not really a recovery day anymore, meaning you’ll be less recovered going into your next workout. You could even do your lift before your run, but at that point you’re putting the emphasis on the lift and that will provide a greater stimulus than the run, turning your run into more of a test of your body's fatigue resistance. A general rule of thumb is to do three sets of 8-12 reps per exercise, and shoot for hitting each core movement at least once per lift, although I like to add one or two more exercises to emphasize whatever movement I see fit on the day. The rest you take will vary based on what your goal is: if it's to build fatigue resistance/strength endurance, you should take shorter rest between reps; if it's to build pure strength, then you'll want longer rest periods between reps. Typically, runners should be in the gym for the latter. As for how much weight to use, if you're new to strength training, master the above movements with your bodyweight before introducing additional weight; doing a movement poorly will ingrain poor habits. Once you've done that, you can introduce additional weight to the exercises and gradually progress that as you adapt. Notably, strength training should look different based on the period of training you're in. If you're in a base-building block, the focus should probably be on more general, strength-based and stability-based movements where you’re lifting heavier with fewer reps. However, as a training block progresses and becomes harder, strength sessions should become more and more running-specific with the weight coming down and the reps going up.

Pro tip: Superset exercises to save time. Have the first exercise of a superset focus on one area then the following exercise hit an entirely different area so there’s little to no overlap. An example would be doing three sets of (10 push-ups, 10 DB rows) or three sets of (10 hamstring curls with yoga ball, 10 SL squats).

EXAMPLE
Here is an example lifting session w/ 30" rest between reps and 2' rest between sets:
Lunge - 3x10 runner's lunges
Squat - 3x10 basic squat
Hinge - 3x10 kickstand deadlifts
Push + pull - 3x(10 push-ups, 10 bent-over dumb bell rows)
Squat - 3x10 SL squat
Hinge - 3x10 single-leg RDLs

In this session, we’re hitting the lunge, push, and pull movements once and the squat and hinge movements twice to emphasize the latter.

EXERCISES
Here are some example exercises for each movement described above:
Lunge
Runner’s lunges (continue moving forward)
Forward lunges (step forward, then return to original spot)
Sideways lunges
Reverse lunges
Squat
Box squats / heel-raised squats
Bar squats (using a rack)
Goblin squats
Single-leg (SL) squats
Shrimp squats
Pistol squats (if you can do ‘em, lol)
Touchdown squats
Bulgarian split squats
Hinge
Touchdown squats (sometimes exercises overlap between movements so some are multi-functional like this one)
RDLs (both legs and SL)
Glute bridges / hip thrusts
Kickstand deadlift
Trap bar deadlift
Push
Push-ups
Regular bench press
Incline bench press
Pull
Pull-ups
Angled pull-ups with overhead strap
Dumbbell (DB) bench rows
Standing DB rows
Cable pulls

Here are some other good, more isolating exercises that I couldn’t determine a category for:
Side planks (add some spice by raising that outer leg up for extra engagement in the supporting leg’s lateral line (ITB) and glutes)
Regular planks (add some spice with alternating leg raises for good glute engagement, can even do it to where as you lift one leg the other arm goes up at the same time)
Copenhagen planks (start with knees on bench then progress to full leg extension with feet on bench, great for strengthening the often underlooked hip adductor muscles)
Weight drags (on all fours, knees bent at 90 degree angles with lower limbs hanging over the ground, dragging weight across your body in both directions on repeat)
Side walks with a band (more of a rehab exercise but still good for getting glute engagement)
Hamstring curls with a yoga ball (great activation of the posterior chain/hamstrings, focus on engaging your core and keeping the engagement high in the hammies)
Can do single-leg after you get down the basic dual-leg exercise
Runner’s step ups (a great, very running-specific exercise to engage the glutes and lower body)

Some of my personal favorite exercises are the following:
SL RDLs
SL squats
Box squats
Touchdown squats
Runner’s step ups
Copenhagen planks
